# SyncForge

SyncForge is an Android project focused on exploring **reliable background task execution** using **WorkManager**.

This project is built as a **portfolio and learning-focused codebase** to understand how modern Android apps schedule, chain, retry, and observe background work under real-world constraints.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Explore WorkManager fundamentals and guarantees
- Understand background execution constraints
- Model realistic sync and retry scenarios
- Build clean, testable background workflows

---

## 🧱 Architecture

- Clean Architecture (UI / Domain / Data)
- Domain-driven background use cases
- Workers as thin execution layers
- Business logic isolated from Android framework

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Kotlin
- WorkManager
- Coroutines + Flow
- Hilt
- Material 3

---

## 📌 Project Status

🚧 **Under Active Development**  
Initial focus is on background orchestration and reliability.  
Features, documentation, and UI will evolve incrementally.
